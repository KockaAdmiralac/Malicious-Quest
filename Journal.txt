4/5/607.
I'm in Whitown.
People here are dying from work, and nobody is
actually noticing I'm here.
Whatever, I don't think I should even be noticed.
I think I'll go to Armadillo Town soon.
[===]
18/9/607.
I moved to Armadillo Town. People here are always
in their houses, and nothing is actually
happening... I'm bored.
[===]
7/10/607.
Moved to Esteban City, I could not stand Armadillo
Town. All my old friends are here. They have various
reasons for being here, one say that Aeon City is
too busy, others say that in Ingrid City they are
too opsessed with Ingrid. 
I think that Ingrid never did something useful, but
who knows, it happened centuries ago...
Others say that Amber City is too small.
I don't think so, but I know why they think so.
They think so because Amber City is too far from here,
so most of them had never been in Amber City.
Classic.
So I think I'll stay here longer than usual.

13/4/608.
I just thought about something...
What if I made my own secret organization that should be
protecting Twel?
Since King is just too stupid to do so, I think that is
a good idea...
I even found a great place for the headquarters...
Underneath Esteban Storage I heard that there are some 
tunnels that people build back in the Runderghal time.
[===]
23/5/608.
Something strange happened today.
I was talking to my friend at Oblivion Lake, and suddenly
I heard something happening at Runderghal.
I hurried there, and saw some THING that was attacking
the guard.
That THING was a girl with a tail.
I tried to shoo her away with my skills, but she just
smiled...
Then I tried my secret skill, the one I used against 
The One.
Guard fainted, and cat girl fell down.
I thought she is dead, but then she woke up, and walked
toward me. 
She was stronger than The One.
I thought she'll toss me away, but she just stood and
looked at me.
After some time, she said : "I know that you want
to make a secret organization. Make it. Do not
hesitate, because I haven't seen somebody that
strong for a long time..."
And then she ran to the forest.
Trees fell down behind her.
I'd never seen her again.
[===]
24/5/608.
Well, here I am, building the headquarters.
Some people offered to join already, and between them
I saw one of my old friends, Liben.
He is a very hard worker, so I may put him to the
high place in the organization.
It will be named "Council of the Saint Cat", you know why.
[===]
7/5/609.
Something bad happened today.
Liben turned the organization against me.
He's now sending his agents to attack me in my house.
But, since I guard things well, none of his agents
return successfully.
Actually, none of his agents returned at all...
[===]
4/4/610.
Since that scandal happened, I moved to Lolly Town.
I'm now sitting here, in basement of the storage,
and thinking...
Two cats and a dog are sitting in corners and looking
at me, as always...
Damn this life, I'm heading to the caves!
